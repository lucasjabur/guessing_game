# guessing_game
The Guessing Game is a console game.
The computer is thinking in a number from 1 to 100. Can you guess it?

After playing for the first time a "highscore.txt" file will be created with the number of attempts that took the player to win the game.
A new highscore is set after guessing the number using less attempts than previous games.
